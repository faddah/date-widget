# Date Calendar Widget w/ Digital Clock & Google Chrome Extension

## Made in JavaScript

## Can also be a Google Chrome Browser Extension by using the `manifest.json` file

### This was taken from the [this YouTube instructional video, "Making a Calendar in Vanilla Javascript | Design a Simple Calendar for Your Blog and Website"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn1bNLMTgdo) by [Online Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@OnlineTutorialsYT).

I have taken this code and adjusted the CSS and such and added a manifest.json and icon files to make it into a Google Chrome Browser extension.
